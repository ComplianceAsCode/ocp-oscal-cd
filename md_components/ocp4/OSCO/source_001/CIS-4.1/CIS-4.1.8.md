# CIS-4.1.8 - \[Worker Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the client certificate authorities file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

Ensure that the certificate authorities file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Control rationale_statement

The certificate authorities file controls the authorities used to validate API requests. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

None required.

## Control audit_procedure

The Client CA location for the `kubelet` is defined in `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf`. The 
`/etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt` file has ownership `root:root`.

Run the following command:

```

for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
do
 oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/ca.pem
done
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
