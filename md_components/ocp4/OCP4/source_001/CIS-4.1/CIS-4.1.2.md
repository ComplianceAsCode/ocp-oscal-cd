# CIS-4.1.2 - \[Worker Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the kubelet service file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

Ensure that the kubelet service file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Control rationale_statement

The kubelet service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kubelet service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

By default, the kubelet service file has ownership of `root:root`.

## Control audit_procedure

Run the following command:

```

# Should return root:root for each node
for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
do
 oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host stat -c %U:%G /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service
done
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
